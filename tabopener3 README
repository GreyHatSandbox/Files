# TabOpener3 – Browser Tab Experiment

This script opens a random site in a new tab every 3 seconds.

⚠️ **This is for educational use only.**

## How It Works
- Pasting it into your browser console starts it
- It loops every 3 seconds
- Uses `setInterval` and `window.open`

## How to Stop It
- Run `clearInterval(interval)`
- Or just close the browser tab or window

## Warnings
- Don’t let it run too long — it may slow or crash your PC
- Don’t use this to prank or annoy others
